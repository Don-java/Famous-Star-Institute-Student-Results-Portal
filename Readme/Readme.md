# Student Result Checker

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based student result checker that allows students to enter their unique student ID to retrieve their results. The results are displayed in a formatted table, including subject names, scores, and grades. The system also provides a print functionality for students to print their results.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Secure student ID input
- Displays student name, subjects, scores, and grades
- Error handling for invalid student IDs
- Print functionality for result sheets

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page
- **CSS**: Styling for an aesthetically pleasing layout
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling student result retrieval and printing

## How It Works

1. The student enters their unique ID in the input field.
2. The system checks if the ID exists in the predefined database.
3. If the ID is found, the student's results are displayed in a table.
4. If the ID is invalid, an error message appears.
5. The student can click the "Print" button to print their result.

## Grading System

- **A**: 85 - 100
- **B**: 70 - 84
- **C**: 50 - 69
- **Fail**: Below 50

## Student ID Security

To prevent easy guessing, student IDs have been made more complex and unique.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a valid student ID to check the results.
4. Click "Print" to generate a print-friendly version.

## Future Improvements
